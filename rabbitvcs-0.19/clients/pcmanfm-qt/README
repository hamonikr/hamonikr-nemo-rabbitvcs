RabbitVCS PCManFM-Qt Extension (EXPERIMENTAL!)

This extension is meant to be used with the PCManFM-Qt File Manager

Please note this extension only consists in menu entries and is not a PCManFM-Qt
plugin. As a consequence, RabbitVCS functions are available through PCManFM-Qt
contextual menus, but there is no integration with the PCManFM-Qt main window
interface.

Requirements:
    * PCManFM-Qt
    * (all other RabbitVCS requirements)

To install it on PCManFM-Qt:
    Copy all supplied .desktop files to:
         ~/.local/share/file-manager/actions/

    Install the RabbitCVS CLI client into some PATH directory (i.e.: /usr/bin).
