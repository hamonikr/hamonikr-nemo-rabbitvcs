RabbitVCS Dolphin/KDE[45] Extension (EXPERIMENTAL!)

This extension is meant to be used with the Dolphin File Manager which comes
with KDE 4.x and 5.x

Please note this extension only consists in menu entries and is not a Dolphin
plugin. As a consequence, RabbitVCS functions are available through Dolphin
contextual menus, but there is no integration with the Dophin main window
interface.

Requirements:
    * KDE 4 or 5
    * (all other RabbitVCS requirements)

To install with KDE 4:
    Copy all supplied .desktop files to:
        /usr/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/

    Install the RabbitCVS CLI client into some PATH directory (i.e.: /usr/bin).

    Alternatively you can copy the files to the kde4-directory inside your $HOME, i.e. on Ubuntu 14.04:
        /home/your-username/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/

    In the second case, you may need to create the ServiceMenus folder.
    Please note that the name (i.e. .kde or .kde4) depends on your OS distribution.

To install with KDE 5:
    Copy all supplied .desktop files to:
        /usr/share/kservices5/

    Install the RabbitCVS CLI client into some PATH directory (i.e.: /usr/bin).

    Alternatively you can copy the files for a private user installation to:
        /home/your-username/.local/share/kservices5/
